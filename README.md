# Company Assignment

This is a practical task given by the company to create a simple React application with three pages: Home Page, Contact Page, and Task Page.

![TodoList Home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92534028/232636536-a7bd0956-e840-454c-9171-22362a220b06.png)
 ![todo Contact Form](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92534028/232636552-13e6dc4b-02e7-4a60-987f-9daf77604368.png)


## Pages

### Home Page

This page displays a simple welcome message and a clear button. Clicking on the clear button will clear the data stored in local storage.

### Contact Page

This page includes a form with four fields: First Name, Last Name, Email Id, and Phone Number. Upon successful submission, the form data will be saved in local storage. The stored First Name & Last Name will be displayed on the Home Page.

### Task Page

This page allows users to create and manage their to-do tasks. Tasks will be temporarily held in an array with delete & update functionality.

## General Instructions

- Styled components are used for buttons & form inputs.
- React navigation is used to navigate between screens.
- The form is properly validated.

## How to Run

- Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/ashishingle29/Todo-Task.git Todo-Task`
- Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to run the application.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser to view the application.

## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication to store tasks on a per-user basis.
- Add date and time pickers to the Contact Page form for better input validation.
